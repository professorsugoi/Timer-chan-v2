# Dev Readme

im learning python. hooray! these notes are primarily for me. but you can read them too.. i guess.  

i want to be able to come back 6 months from now and remember what i was doing, so the docstrings may seem a little excessive.  

you're welcome to contribute- just keep in mind that i am a novice coder baby.

## TO DO
- eventually make versions compatible with mac and linux OS
- graphics and styling

---

## docstring template:
```
- purpose of the class and each method
- params and return values (args)
- key functionality and side effects of each method
```

## it's like npm
run `pip install -e .`  

## to test the app
run `python -m src.main`
